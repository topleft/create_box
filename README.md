This is a Python program I wrote while reading the book 'Think Python'. It is
a response to one of the exercises. 

It takes 2 arguments, both of which are strings. These make up the columns 
and rows in your 4 by 16 box table.

I am making a git repo for it so I can practice using the command line and 
gitHub.
